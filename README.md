# gneat - a NEAT algorithm implementation in Go

## About the project

This is my personal hobby project, an attempt to implement the NEAT algorithm based on the research paper published by [Kenneth Stanley](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?kstanley) and [Risto Miikkulainen](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?risto). This project does not directly reference or link to any C++ code in the original implementation but some inspiration will be drawn from it and other NEAT implementations.

## Changelog
